A pleasant diversion
=====================

An unexpectedly pleasant diversion from the news during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the contemplation of a considerable range of data visualisations, from the truly excellent to the amusingly bad. After all, at the excellent end, the crisis has given us the Siouxsie Wiles and Toby Morris “flattening the curve” animated cartoon, the Matt Cowgill “days since 100 cases” chart, and some fantastic animations of infections through networks. Anything that leads to so much discussion of logarithmic scales, the correct usage of statistical adjustments, and even when to use a connected scatter plot has its upside. 

A not-so-good data visualisation
===================================

One chart doing the rounds is sourced from the US state Georgia’s Department of Public Health. It is a bar chart of daily cases over time in Georgia’s five counties with most states.  There’s some some genuine debate in the comments about how it came about – whether there is deliberate deception involved or just a bad judgement.
